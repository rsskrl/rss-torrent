RSS parser, optimized for feeds of torrent trackers.

This RSS parser is used for torrent RSS feeds available on many trackers.
It uses filters to find the right torrent. Best way to use this script
is to put it in cronjob and call it every XX minutes (I use 15).

You can define filters directly on the command line or in files. Defining
filters in files is much easier to administer.  Filters are regular 
expressions and they are not case sensitive.

Every filter is matching from the begining of the torrent title. That 
means that filter "TvShow" will find a torrent "TvShow.S01E01" but it 
will not find "TheTvShow".

Use ".*TvShow" to match "TheTvShow" and "TvShow" with the same filter.

TV Show names in torrents have usually this syntax: TvShowName.S01E01
S01 stands for Season 1, E01 for Episode 1. 

Examples: 

Match all episodes of the 3rd season: "TvShowName.S03E\d\d"
Match episodes 10-15 of the 4th seaons: "TvShowName.S04E1[0-5]
Match "GreatMovie" in 1080p format: "GreatMovie.*1080p"

  Short Regular Expression Help:
  .  = any charcter
  .* = any number (>=0) of any characters (really any characters)
  ?  = 0 or 1 characters before "?". Example: M? (0 or 1 M)
  +  = 1 or more characters before "+": Example: M+ (at least one M)

  Info:
  Filters are regular expressions and you should escape "special" characters
  like ?*$^+ (to match "What?" in a torrent title you should use "What\?").
   


Important:
Matched names are save in the history file. This history file is being
used to avoid downloading torrent for the same content more than once.

If you put only "TvShowName" as a filter and if TvShowName has more
episodes it will be downloaded only once because "TvShowName" will be
saved in the history file. That's why you should use season and episode
numbers in filters for tv shows (like in the examples from above).


Matched "Download filters" will download torrents.
Matched "Inform filters" will run "inform-command" (see --help or below)

Have fun!
